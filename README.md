# hci232 - One iteration of Grinnell's Human-Computer Interaction Course

CSC/PSY/TEC-232 is Grinnell's two-credit course in Human-Computer
Interaction.  Or I should say "was", because the TEC designation is
soon to disappear.  This repo attempts to contain the Web site SamR
created for that course.
