title: Investigation 1
subtitle: Design sensitivity
summary: |
  In this assignment, you will identify and explore a simple design
  problem, sketching a description of the problem in a way that may
  help others understand it.
collaboration: |
  You may work alone or in a team of up to three students.  You may
  consult other students in the class as you develop your solution.  If you
  receive help from anyone, make sure to cite them in your responses.

From your **direct** observation of someone else having difficulty
using a machine, a computer application, or any designed artifact,
prepare a short description (including both text and diagrams as
appropriate), sketching the situation and explaining the difficulty.
Additionally, think about and note the various perspectives of those
who may have created the situation (i.e., Why would someone choose
to design it this way?).  Be prepared to present it to the class.

Please look for something that others might not think of: The more
diverse the examples we share in class, the better. I'd definitely
like to see a fair number of non-computer ones!

Format
------

If we were in person, you would be preparing your description as a
physical poster.  Since we are working online, your description
should take the form of the equivalent of a single "page" to show
on a computer screen, most likely in landscape format (so that it
uses much of the screen), such as a slide from a Powerpoint or
Google Slides.  

We will tour through your individual pages during class.

You need not (and, in fact, should not) prepare a polished essay
or polished poster.  Your goal is to quickly capture and communicate
a design problem, factors that may have contributed to the given
design, and a possible solution.

Goals
-----

### Human-centered

Begin by think about problems that *you* have had.  (That should be
comparatively easy.)  But challenge yourselves by trying to notice the
problems that *others* have had or are having.  Consider how you watch
and how you uncover intentions.

### Critical search

Now that you've read the first chapter of Norman's _The Design of
Everyday Things_, you might be able to pick up some of his spirit
in your search for design problems.  Poorly designed everyday things
may be the hardest to notices.  Apply concepts to consider _why_
things are difficult to use.

### Multiple modalities

Good designers represent what they have learned with multiple
modalities: sketches, annotated photos, flowcharts, cartoons,
outlines, stories, tables, and more.  Try out a variety of these
modalities, using them together as time and space permit.

### Multiple perspectives

Try to understand and explain what factors led to the (seemingly
poor) design.   Any design is the result of compromises.  There is
seldom one right answer. Think about the historical, economic,
aesthetic, political, physical, and personal factors that played
(or may have played) a part in influencing your subject design.

Assessment
----------

I will assess your work with respect to the four goals above, each
with respect to the clarity (not polish!) of your presentation.  The
rubric I use for each follows.

<table class="table">
  <tr><td>Plus</td> <td>Exceeds goal</td> <td>4.2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Check</td> <td>Meets goal</td> <td>3.5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Minus</td> <td>Fails to meet goal</td> <td>2.5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Zero</td> <td>Not submitted</td> <td>0</td></tr>
</table>
