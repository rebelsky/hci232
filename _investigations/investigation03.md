  You may work alone or in a team of up to four students.  You may
  consult other students in the class as you develop your solution.  If you
  receive help from anyone, make sure to cite them in your responses.

In this assignment you will practice the contextual inquiry
methodology. You will then use the data from your contextual inquiry to
perform a task analysis.

The objectives of this exercise are to sharpen your powers of
observation, to develop your ability to ask more and more precise
questions, to practice describing your observations, and to experiment
with task representations.

## Assignment

In group of three or four students (assigned), identify a domain in
which none of you are experts, but for which you can identify several
"local" experts. For example, we have a number of Ultimate players
at Grinnell; several students work as class mentors, or perhaps you
have friends who have experience planning backpacking trips.

Identify three people who are willing to let your group observe the
work they do in this domain.  (The interviewees should not be
enrolled in our course.)  Interview each of these participants using
the contextual inquiry methodlogy.  Plan to spend between thirty
and forty-five minutes in each session.  If it is not possible to
observe them in their normal work setting, instead ask them to
demonstrate as concretely as possible how they carry out one of
their work activities (e.g., how they do an overhand throw, prepare
for a mentor session, or pack a backpack for a week-long trip).

Normally we would ask you to attempt the observations in person,
in the normal location of the work (e.g., on Mac field for the
Ultimate players).  However, that may not be possible during the
pandemic.  Feel free to rely on remote interviews.

Each member of your group should participate in at least two interviews,
and each interview should include at least two interviewers.

Finally, describe three kinds of tasks in more detail: (a) an easy
task; (b) a difficult task; and (c) one in between.  Aim to
describe the tasks in enough detail such that someone who is completely
unfamiliar with the activity would get a good idea of what is involved;
try to capture both commonalities and variability in what you observed
across different participants. Choose one or more representations for
each task. 

## Work to submit

Write a short report structured as follows. I encourage you to
include photographs, sketches, diagrams, or other representations.
(Note: A quick and easy way to get a diagram into a document is to
sketch it on paper or a whiteboard and then take a photo with your
mobile phone.)

### Report structure and rubric

Overview (2 points)
  : Describe at a high level the domain you chose and the activities you observed.

Contextual inquiry participants (7 points)
  : Describe the rationale behind your choice of contextual inquiry participants. For each of the three participants, give some details of their background and the environment where you observed their work.

Contextual inquiry results (7 points)
  : Identify high level tasks and themes that the participants shared
  in common in their practices. Then, note anything unique about each
  interview and comment on the rationale behind these events.

Task descriptions (9 points, 3 per task)
  : Describe three tasks (easy, moderate, and difficult) in more
  detail, using one or more representations.  You may use different
  representations for different tasks. Explain why you rated each
  task as easy, moderate, or difficult, and your choice of
  representation.

Design concepts (5 points)
  : Using writing, pictures, or both, sketch out a few ideas for how
    new or redesigned information technology might help users accomplish
    these tasks.  Consider using scenarios or use cases.  If you do not
    see a place for new technology, explain why not.

Reflection (2 points)
  : What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment?  Why?

### Submitting

You will submit your work in the "Investigation 3" channel on Teams.

## Citations

As is often the case, this investigation is closely based on one written by Janet Davis for a prior offering of HCI 232.

Dr. Davis indicates that her version of the investigation is "a bricolage of assignments by Blomberg, et al. (1995), James Fogarty, and Jim Boerkel."
