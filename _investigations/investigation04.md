## Preparation

Before you start this assignment, you should read about usability testing
on [Usability.gov](https://usability.gov) and work on your reading journal.

## Assignment

* Identify a Web site or mobile application to test.  For example, you
  might choose <https://iowapublicradio.org>.  
    * If you prefer, you may use a Web site or app you have built.  
    * Please do not use a particularly popular Web site or app,
      such as Amazon, Facebook, or Google, unless you plan
      to focus on functionality that you expect is rarely used.
      The goal of this assignment is to see how people work with
      less familiar material and when people use a function often,
      they tend to find ways to work around usability problems or
      just take them for granted.
* We would normally have you recruit three participants.  However,
  we will instead use the other members of class as participants and
  conduct the usability studies during class time.
* Develop three small but realistic tasks that someone might want
  to do using the Web site.  These should be relatively high-level
  tasks; please don't give clues as to how to achieve them.  And
  please don't choose tasks that require the exchange of personal
  information or money.  For example, here are some scenarios for IPR.
    * Determine which frequencies we should be able to use to
      hear IPR on the radio in Grinnell.  (Yes, we could listen
      on our computers, but we'll ignore that.)
    * I like to listen to "The Folk Tree" but always forget when it
      is.  When can I listen?
    * I heard a show I liked Tuesday at 11 am.  What was it?
* Sketch out a script for the facilitator.  I recommend that you start
  with the sample scripts provided by [Steve Krug](https://sensible.com/download-files/) or [Usability.gov](https://usability.gov).
* Pilot-test your secnarios and script by doing a practice session within
  your team or with Mai.  Make sure the scenarios are clear and that the
  tasks can be completed in 15 minutes or less.  Revise as necessary.
* Carry out your usability tests (in class).  Assign each team member a role,
  ensuring that there is a facilitator and at least one observer. Every team 
  member should experience each role at least once. 

     Remember that it is ok to provide a hint if the user is clearly
     stuck. You should abort the test if you run out of time or things
     otherwise go really wrong. If you find after your first participant
     that your tasks are unclear, you may revise them. 

* Debrief on the test sessions. Your goal is to identify the three
  most serious usability problems you saw.
* Finally, prepare your report as a team.  (Sorry, that won't happen in
  class.)

## Report

Write a short report structured as follows. You are encouraged to
include sketches, screen shots, short video clips, or other
representations.

### Method (5 points)

Document your approach to the usability test.

* Name the site or app you tested and explain why you chose it.
* Present your scenarios (a bulleted list is fine) and briefly explain
  why you chose them.
* Describe your participants.  (Do not identify them by name.)
* How did you collect data from the sessions?  Did you record the
  sessions?  If so, with what tools?

### Usability problems (12 points)

Identify the three most serious usability problems you saw.  For each
problem, address the following questions.

* What was the problem?  Describe it as clearly and objectively as
  possible.
* How many participants experienced the problem?
* How severe was the problem?  (Your scale might range from "a minor
  annoyance" to "prevented participant from completing the task".)
* What do you recommend the site developers do to resolve the problem?
 
### Reflection (3 points)

Briefly reflect on three of the following questions (whichever you find
most interesting).

* Did you create the site/app you tested, or did someone else?         
  How did that affect your ability to conduct the usability test?
* How do you think the use of other students in the class as test
  subjects affected the process?
* How did you revise your scenarios after the pilot?  Why?  (Do not
  say "We didn't"; if that's the case, chose another question.)
* What did you find most challenging about each role (facilitatior
  and observer)?
* Did you discover additional problems by observing the second 
  and third participants? Do you think you would have learned more by           
  observing more participants?
* Are your proposed solutions the absolute best solutions you can 
  think of ("the perfect") or the least work possible to make things 
  better ("the good")?  Why did you make that choice?

## Acknowledgements

This assignment is closely based on one Janet Davis wrote for the Spring
2015 section of HCI, although it has been adapated to the complexity of
an online accelerated term.  That assignment was based on one Dr. Davis
has previously written for CSC-105, _The Digital Age_.
