Q&A

Debrief on Friday's activities
------------------------------

### What did you learn about quick-and-dirty usability testing?

### What would you do differently next time?

### What did you learn being a research subject?

### How did the rapid-interview technique work?  

Should I use it again when I teach the class again?  How should I modify it?

Notes are in the channel for this class period (at least I think they are).
