Q&A
---

Do we need to meet with our investigation 4 partner over the weekend?

> Nope.

Do we know our partner for investigation 4?

> Posted in the Investigation 4 channel.
  <https://teams.microsoft.com/_?tenantId=524f9e3e-faca-4f64-b3ec-adb2baee8807#/conversations/Investigation%204%20-%20Usability%20Testing?groupId=d003196b-1954-4805-a759-17273e7a225d&threadId=19:9cc4c7a53bf247e480b4acac1f9e5273@thread.tacv2&ctx=channel>

Personas
--------

What are personas?

* A model personality of someone who might be using our product.
  Their age, gender, background, other information about them.
* May also want to think about their relationship to the product; their
  goals, etc.
* Assumptions about what they know, etc.
* May have different levels of depth.

Why do we have personas?

* They help us have conversations across different teams.  They help
  communicate goals and important features.
* They let us think about "the other", particularly as we create scenarios.
* Help consolidate demographic information into something that we can more
  easily use.

What are some of the downfalls to using personas?

* They can marginalize people who are not part of the persona-d population.
* They may lead us to generalize and stereotype, so they may not even
  be accurate for the demographics we hope to model.
* Different people may interpret a persona differently.  How do we achieve
  a common understanding?  Should someone represent the persona?
  (Personas are subjective.)
* Personas may not represent our actual users.
* Designing a persona requires particular skills that not all of us may have.
  (And many people try to create them without those skills.)
* You can't really validate a persona.

What alternatives are there to using personas?

* Use real human beings, which allow us to go beyond our imagination.
    * Still has problems of marginalization.
    * Hard to find representative real human beings.
* Write scenarios without worrying about particular users.
    * But then we are more likely to focus on our own perspective, rather
      than those of others.
* Write personas in a way that we can measure the characteristics.
* Don't look for alternatives; accept that you are generalizing.  Be
  vigilant about the tradeoffs.
* Accept that everything is flawed.  You have to pick something.

How do we avoid the downfalls?

* If we're using personas, how do we avoid marginalizing certain populations?
  (One obvious one: The disabled.)
    * Identify people in the marginalized populations and interview them
      to better understand them.  Use to build personas.
    * Create a wide variety of personas and make sure they represent
      approprirate communities.
    * Checklists of groups often marginalized.
* How do we avoid stereotyping our users when we build personas?
    * Collect good data about the users so that we can use the data
      in building our personas.
    * Work with an open mind.  Hold a neutral point of view.
    * Try to eliminate the variables that variables that would treat
      the person unequally.
    * Have a team build the persona (ideally a multi-cultural team)

Note

* Good persona design is not cheap.
* In spite of that, it can be useful even if not perfect.

Break!

Interview exercise 
------------------

_With investigation 4 partner._

"What is your experience using Web Advisor for academic planning?"

* P1 initiates the chat
* Five minutes P1 interviews P2 (open-ended interview)
* Five minutes P2 interviews P1 (open-ended interview)
* Three minutes to talk about Investigation 4
* Come back and debrief

What was the hardest part of doing a short informational interview?  (Other
than trying to keep it to five minutes and doing it with no prep?)

* Sam designed the assignment badly, the second question should have
  been about something different. 
* Coming up with something different when being interviewed? [+1]
* Complaints are minor and specific; how do you get on to bigger issues?
* Coming up with questions.
* People quickly move into frustrations.

What would you do differently?  (Other than actually prepare?)

* Take the time to understand what they liked and didn't like.
* Have followup questions.
* Go in well-informed about the topic.

How do you have good followup questions?

* Pay attention and pick up on lose ends.
* Rely on the generic "Tell me more about X"a.
* Prepare possible followup questions based on your knowledge of the topic.

What is something that worked really well in the interview?

* _This question was skipped._

What did you learn about the tasks users have for the academic advising
software?

* Find grades from previous semesters.
* Searching for classes and adding them to your schedule so that you and
  your advisor can plan.
* Bookmark the site.

What did you learn about the frustations users have for the academic advising
software?

Investigation 3 team meetings
-----------------------------

On our own.  Twenty minutes.  I hope that was enough.
