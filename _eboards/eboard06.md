Q&A
---

Do all three subjects need to mention the tasks we use?

> No.  As long as you think the tasks are common to the work.

Are there particular parts where we should be including sketches, diagrams, photos, etc.?

> No.  Anywhere you consider appropriate.

Are our grades up?

> No.

Will they be available at some point?

> Yes.  Soonish.  Email.

Class design debrief
--------------------

The structure of classes is always a design question.  The design of
online accelerated classes is especially challenging, particularly when
it's a new topic for the instructor.  So it's time for a design debrief
slash discussion.  Here are some characteristics we might consider.

Workload

* Goal: "Enough work that I feel like I'm learning, but not too much."
* Components:
    * Readings
    * Reading journals
    * Tasks
    * Investigations
* _Questions: How is the workload?  What kinds of work are more/less
  successful? What adjustments should I make?_

Primary in-class components

* Fridays as demo/debrief days.
* Use of TPS/TGS as a primary strategy.
* Assorted mini-lectures.
* Anti-component: Assumption that we don't need to discuss every reading; 
  you've learned from reading and reflecting.
* Etc.
* _Questions: How is the balance?  Do you need more in-class time on
  readings?  How should we gather info from TPS (or do we need to)?
  Do you want more in-class time to work with your investigation group?
  What adjustments should I/we make?_

Finding out what's due

* Teams channels (sometimes posted a bit late)
* Links from the daily eboards.
* Links from the schedule (not always there)
* Email (not used any more)
* _Question: Can you find what's due easily enough?_

UD in class

* Eboards
* Distracting Otter.ai transcriptions
* Class recordings
* _Question: What else would support you?_

Group roles (assign when starting):

* Leader
* Scribe / Rapporteur
* Encourager
* Others ... (Oooh!  A good question for the conversation.)
* _Question: What other roles should people play in group discussions?_

Reports: What do you want me to know?

* Workload is a bit much, particularly with Friday.  Investigation +
  reading plus task.  (Needs to be less.)
    * Option one: Simplify investigations
    * Option two: Cut readings and tasks
    * Also: More time in class for investigations.  Fixed?
    * More time for investigation 3 would be good.  Fixed.
* Think and Pair covers most of the material, so it's not clear that
  we need a share.  The "Comment on Teams" worked well as a use of
  class time.
* Question: Can you post non-hidden channels?
    * Yes, but there's a limit.
* Scheduling is a bother over Zoom (or whatever).
    * Maybe fewer subjects.
    * Maybe design things for which class members can be subjects +
      class time for subject testing.
* In-class discussions of the readings would be nice.  (Not sure what
  to cut.) [+1]
* Can we invite an alum to come in and give us a lecture?  (Sam will
  try to fit that in.)
* Please put links to the assignments or tasks on the course Web site.
  And send us reminders!  (E.g., email or announcements channel)
* Please give us feedback!
* Time on Mondays for investigation group. (20-30 minutes)

Other group roles

* It's organic; trust the nature of the group.
* Timekeeper; remind us that Sam gave us limited time.

Thinking about users
--------------------

* When should you involve users in your design?
* What information should you gather from users at each phase?
* How should you gather that information?
* What should you do with that information?

### When to involve users

* Design is supposed to be iterative, so the only good answer is "all
  the time"
* At the beginning, to gather requirements/tasks.
* After specifying the first set of requirements/tasks, to review those
  tasks.
* After ideate, to see whether your ideations seem reasonable.
* After prototyping, to experiment with prototypes
* After implementing, to ensure implementation works well.
* And more.  (Remember that all of this cycles.)

### Information we gather from users (and then represent)

Example system: A Learning Management System (LMS) better than
blackboard.

* Goals.
    * Respond appropriately to questions on the discussion board
      so that I can impress my professor and get a good participation
      score.
    * Participate in discussions so that I can better engage with
      the course content.
* Needs.
    * Up-to-date access to the content of the discussion boards.
* Accessibility needs.
* Stories.  These help us begin to understand the goals and needs.
    * I had a class on Blackboard in which the class was held on the
      discussion board.  I found myself frustrated that I could not
      see what others were writing while I was writing.
    * I used the Blackboard App on my phone to keep track of all
      that stuff: The assignments I have due, my current grades,
      announcements from the course.  The app would also give me
      notifications, e.g., "Rebelsky just posted another assignment."
      These days, I need to use the Web app, which doesn't give me
      notifications.
* **Personas**: Desires.  Expectations.  Characteristics.  The kinds of
  people who will use our system with some detail about them.
    * Personas can be very different and affect what we do with
      systems and how we interact with them.
* Context.  Environment in which they are doing things.
    * Network of people.
* **Tasks** they are trying to achieve.
* Big picture ideas.
* Feedback
    * Explicit: Comments from them about the product.
    * Implicit: The state that they're in.  (E.g., do they achieve flow
      from our product).  (Emotional state.)
    * Some is conceptual, some is numeric.  "How long does it take
      them to accomplish this task?"

### Mechanisms for gathering that information

* Observe users in their natural state.
    * Open-ended
    * Retrospective questions (often aided by video)
    * "How would you do this task?"
        * Ask them to do it.
            * Might not give enough explanation.
            * Might not tell you what is happening in their mind.
            * Can interfere with processing.
        * Ask them to explain the steps they would go through.
            * People might mislead (intentionally or accidentally)
    * Do you ask questions while you are watching them?
        * Observe quietly?  Doesn't interrupt them.  Q's disrupt observation
          process.
        * Ask question: Helps reveal feelings, underlying context; people
          explain things better at the time; gives you a better understanding.
    * Try doing the things you will be working with.
* Informational interviews
    * Ask them for stories.
    * Individual/group
    * Lewis chapter: "What do you want to do with this system?"  Open-ended
      questions.
* Present and then ask for feedback.  Good way to check yourself.
* Surveys
* Technology (eye trackers, timers, screen recorders, ...)

### Using that information

Investigation 3 Group Chat
--------------------------

* Twenty minutes now.
* Twenty-thirty on Friday.
