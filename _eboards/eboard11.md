Administrative stuff
--------------------

### General Notes

* Congratulations to those of you who were admitted to Phi Beta Kappa
  at yesterday's ceremony.  (Congratulations to all of you for bei
  awesome people.)
* Happy Friday!  I hope you have a wonderful weekend.  Don't
  forget that we celebrate Mother's day in the US this weekend.
  If you are fortunate enough to have a mother, and a mother
  with whom you get along, please wish them a happy mother's day.
* Grades should be forthcoming on Monday.  (Don't worry, if you turn
  in everything, you pass.)
* I've cancelled Investigation 7.  We'll do something similar (but lighter)
  in class.
* Although the final is listed on the schedule, there is no final.
  Ideally, you'll have everything done by the last day of class.

### Upcoming Activities

* Saturday: The Grinnellian 2-6 p.m.  An open mic at the commencement stage.
* Sunday: ISO Cultural Evening, 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
* Next Thursday: Some CS talk.  Or maybe Data Science.

### Work for Monday's class

* Decide which task you want to work on.  We'll spend part of Monday's
  class talking about prototypes and part of Monday's class buidling 
  them.
* Readings forthcoming this evening.

### Work for Friday's class

* Have prototypes ready to test.  (Probably half the class time.)
  I *think* we can do focus-group-style testing.

### Work for Monday the 17th

* [Investigation 6: Prototyping](../investigations/investigation06)
