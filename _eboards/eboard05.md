### Work for Friday's class

* [Investigation 3](../investigations/investigation03): Users and their
  tasks.
    * Teams are posted on the Investigation 3 channel on the class team.
    * I've used the NATO Phonetic Alphabet to name teams. (The NATO
      Phonetic Alphabet was an interesting design challenge.)
    * [Investigation 3 channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:175aa410f2bd4d91b07dcb7664cc5194@thread.tacv2/1618599373077?tenantId=524f9e3e-faca-4f64-b3ec-adb2baee8807&groupId=d003196b-1954-4805-a759-17273e7a225d&parentMessageId=1618599373077&teamName=HCI-232-01%202021SpT2&channelName=Journal%20for%20Class%2006a%20-%20Primary%20Points&createdTime=1618599373077)
* More readings!

Q&A
---

Box and Room Fair
-----------------

Process (feel free to modify):

* Tell us about your project.
* Show us your project.
* Sam shows the video (in most cases).
* Tell us about your observations.
* Q&A

Observations

* Asking questions is hard.
* Some people don't know when to stop.  Signal stopping? [x3]
* Context matters: People may use a handle if the box is on the ground
  but not if it's on the table.
* Don't lie to your users.
* People interpret words differently.
* Don't suck up to your faculty.
* Users can be easily frustrated.
* The substances and technologies we use to build devices can make
  our lives more difficult.
* Sometimes people use parts of your tool in unexpected ways.
* People are destructive.
* Security
* Scope can be complicated.
* Don't include too many features.
* Instructions can limit play.
* Sometimes there are enough affordances that people may not use your
  intended affordances.
* Technology makes people feel stupid.
* Some natural affordances IRL are not natural affordances in
  cyberspace (particularly simulations).

Debrief
-------

_TPS_

* What did you learn in doing the project?
* What did you learn from listening to other peoples' projects?
* What if you could not have used writing?
* What other than texture would get people to rub a box?

Class design debrief
--------------------

The structure of classes is always a design question.  The design of
online accelerated classes is especially challenging, particularly when
it's a new topic for the instructor.  So it's time for a design debrief
slash discussion.  Here are some characteristics we might consider.

Workload

* Enough work that I feel like I'm learning, but not too much.
* I'm only taking ten credits; you could double the workload.
* It's more than a two-credit class should be, but that's okay because
  it's fun!
* It's my last term, please cut back.

Primary in-class components

* Fridays as demo/debrief days.
* Use of TPS as a primary strategy.
* Assorted mini-lectures.
* Anti-component: Assumption that we don't need to discuss every reading; 
  you've learned from reading and reflecting.
* Etc.

Finding out what's due

* Teams channels (sometimes posted a bit late)
* Links from the daily eboards.
* Links from the schedule (not always there)
* Email (not used any more)

UD in class

* Eboards
* Distracting Otter.ai transcriptions
* Class recordings

Questions for you to discuss

* What is going well?
* What should I improve (if I can find time)?
* Anything else to add/subtract/modify/try/whatever?
