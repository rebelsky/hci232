Q&A

Instructions for today
----------------------

Please hold meetings and focus groups in the Investigations 6 channel.
That will allow Mai and me to visit your meetings.

The channel should include a list of what group goes when and
who they interview.

While I've allowed twenty-five minutes for each group, it's okay if
you go a bit long.

Use your prep time to make sure that your script is in order, that
you all know your roles, and other similar things.

Invite your participants at the start of the focus group session.
