Administrative stuff
--------------------

### General Notes

* Happy second day of Spring Term 2!
* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).  
    * Mai Phuong Vu is our awesome class mentor.
    * A class mentor is a person who exists as a resource for the topic
      and the class.
* The class Web site is (or will be) at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/HCI232/2021SpT2/>.
    * Sam: Don't forget to put that link in the chat.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress.
* We are using Microsoft Teams for this class.  You can (should?) use Teams 
  for other communication, too.
    * I'd like to see your face during class (as much as Teams allows),
      but I do not require it.
    * The ellipses button (three dots) at the top lets you set a background.
    * You can use the chat how you'd like.  I'll check it from time to time,
      but you should feel free to use it for snarky comments about
      my teaching, greetings to each other, comments about pets
      that wander onscreen, etc.
    * Feel free to raise your hand using the Teams "raise hand" feature.
      I probably won't notice, but others will and will tell me.
    * I will forget to share my screen.  Please remind me.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make nice Web pages.
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.  **Done!**
    * Don't just rely on mine; evidence suggests taking your own notes 
      helps you learn.

### Upcoming Activities

* CS Table, Monday.  [_Addiction By Design_](https://muse-jhu-edu.grinnell.idm.oclc.org/book/61897), Introduction to Part II and Chapter 4, "Matching the Market: Innovation, Intensification, Habituation". 
* Get Vaccinated!

* *Journal questions for Monday will appear Saturday evening.*
* *A task for Monday will also appear Saturday evening.*

### Attendance

_Yes, I realize that this takes some time.  But we'll be working as a
community, so I think it's important to get to know each other._

* I will (attempt to) call you by first name.
* You will respond with 
    * "Hi, my name is FULL NAME.
    * (Optional pronouns.)
    * If you must call me by last name, please call me Mr./Ms./Mx./Scholar
      FAMILY NAME.  (Warning: Sam may default to Scholar NAME.)
    * I'm taking HCI-232 because ...
    * I bring ... to the class
    * This term, I am excited about ....
    * (Optional question for me.  You'll also have another chance later.)

### Q&A

How are you Sam?

> Great.  Or at least alive.

> Behind.

What does "TPS" stand for?

> "Think, Pair, Share", a standard mechanism for ensuring that every
  student thinks about a topic and can contribute.  I often use TPS
  of trios and quartets, two.

Exercise 0: About the topic
---------------------------

_A TPS exercise._

Questions

* What is HCI?
* How does HCI relate to UI, to UX, to Design, to ...?
* How do those other things relate to each other?
* How would you fix the sign, particularly for Noyce, South Campus, and HSSC?

Process

* **Think**: Five minutes answering the questions.  
    * Yes, you can do Web searches.  (Is there a verb for "DuckDuckGo"?)
    * Yes, you should write or type your answers.
* **Pair**: Discuss for three minutes with another person.  
    * Sam will randomly pair students.
* **Share**: Discuss with the broader group.

### A graphic about HCI

* We understand Venn diagrams, and assume things that look like
  Venn diagrams are Venn diagrams.
* Isn't it sad that a site about HCI does this?
* That undermines anything about the site.

### What is HCI? (Human-Computer Interaction)

* Definition: The study of how humans and computers interact.
* Intended to be a a fairly big umbrella term.
* Includes lots of other things: UI, UX, psychology, human factors, etc.
* The parts can be examined separately.
* Establishes a framework.
* Like most broad/umbrella terms (e.g., Psychology, CS), it encompasses
  a lot of different things.
    * Careful study of the efficiacy of a user interface.  (A-B test.)
    * Development of new tools for interacting with a computer.
    * Study of how people use computers, often using careful tracking.
    * Design (and perhaps assessment) of the broad "user experience"
    * ...
* You said: "I want to be able to design better interfaces."
    * One strategy: Study (users), ideate, build/prototype, study, iterate
    * Another strategy: Checklists

### How does HCI relate to UI, to UX, to Design, to ...?

* A predecessor to UI/UX.  HCI is more on the research side?  A way to
  back up the UI/UX.
    * Don't just design things without knowing something about what
      makes a good design.
    * Anything done correctly relies on research.
    * You can/should do research on UIs
    * You can/should do research on UXs

### How do those other things relate to each other?

* UX comes before UI: Think about the overall experience and then
  think about how to achieve it.  Design connects the two.
* A good UI leads to good UX.  A good design leads to a good UI.
    * The UI for threads on Twitter is pretty mediocre, but the overall
      UX is fairly immersive.
* UX is more about processes and flows; UI is how those processes and
  flows are presented to the user.
* Can you save a bad UX with a good UI?

### How would you fix the sign, particularly for Noyce, South Campus, and HSSC?

About the course
----------------

### Theme

* Get you to be a more informed conformed/builder of user interfaces.

### Structure

* Bi-weekly two-hour meetings.
* Synchronous and semi-interactive.  (Lots of breakout and report back.)
* Learn and demonstrate learning through
    * Reading journals (read, think, answer qustions in Teams channel)
    * "Tasks" (think/do, post in Teams channel)
    * "Investigations": practice applying the steps/process of good
      design
    * Discuss, think, etc.

### Workload

* Grinnell says "a two-credit course represents 90 hours of work"
* 90/7 = 12 hours per week.  If you are taking two other 4-credit courses
  that's 60 hours per week.  That's inappropriate.
* "90 hours for who and for what grade?"
* My goal: "12 hours per week for students who work slowly and want an A+++"
    * Let me know if I screw up.
* Twelve hours per week is
    * Four hours in class
    * Three-four hours reading and writing journal responses
        * 30 min per journal response
        * One hour of reading per class
    * Three-four hours per investigation
* It should be fun.  So we'll call it "fun load" instead of workload.
* Grading: You can redo anything.

### Some Disclaimers

* 24 students, one Sam, grading will be slow.
* Sam is behind on getting the class set up.
* HCI is not my research specialization.

Questions?

Break for the weekend
---------------------


Exercise 1: Identifying common themes
-------------------------------------

_A TPS exercise._

a. Make a list of things that reflect good UI design.  [2 min]

b. Discuss with your team. [4 min]

c. Make a list of things that reflect poor UI design.  [2 min]

d. Discuss with your team. [4 min]

e. Read through the responses to Task 0 and see what other themes appear [5 min]

f. Discuss with your team. [5 min]

g. Return to the class and be prepared to share. [n min]

Exercise 2: Groupthink
----------------------

_Another TPS exercise._

You likely come to this class with different experiences in group work.
I will tell you that experience and evidence suggest that assigning roles
in groups can help.  For example, you might have one person responsible
for ensuring that everyone talks (an "encourager") and another person
responsible for summarizing the discussion (a "rapporteur").

As a group, come up with a list of what you think are the most important 
roles and a protocol (or protocols) for assigning those roles.
